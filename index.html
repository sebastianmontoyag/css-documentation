                    <p>Cascading Style Sheets is a stylesheet 
                        language used for describe the presentation of 
                        an HTML or XML document. CSS describes how elements
                         should be rendered.</p>
                    <p>
                        It is one of the core languages of the open Web and 
                        is standardized across Web browsers according to the
                         W3C specification.</p>
                    <p>
                        From CSS3, the scope of the specification increased 
                        significantly and the progress on different CSS 
                        modules started to differ so much, that it became 
                        more effective to develop and release recommendations 
                        separately per module. Instead of versioning the CSS
                         specification, W3C now periodically takes a snapshot of
                          the latest stable state of the CSS specification.

                    <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and layout web 
                        pages — for example, to alter the font, color, size, and
                         spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, 
                         or add animations and other decorative features. </p>

                    <P>CSS is a rule-based language — you define rules specifying 
                        groups of styles that should be applied to particular 
                        elements or groups of elements on your web page. For 
                        example "I want the main heading on my page to be shown 
                        as large red text."</P>

                    <p>The following code shows a very simple CSS rule that would 
                        achieve the styling described above:</p>
                    <div class="code-snippet">
                        <pre>
                            <code>
                                h1 {
                                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;color: red;
                                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;font-size: 5em;
                                }
                            </code>
                        </pre>
                    </div>
                    

                    <p>The rule opens with a selector . This selects the HTML 
                        element that we are going to style. In this case we are 
                        styling level one headings.</p>


                    <p>We then have a set of curly braces { }. Inside those will 
                        be one or more declarations, which take the form of property 
                        and value pairs. Each pair specifies a property of the element(s) 
                        we are selecting, then a value that we'd like to give the property.</p>

                    <p>Before the colon, we have the property, and after the colon, the value. 
                        CSS properties have different allowable values, depending on which 
                        property is being specified. In our example, we have the 
                        color property, which can take various color values. We 
                        also have the font-size property. This property can take various 
                        size units as a value.</p>

                    
                </content>
            </section>
            <section id="more_syntax!" class="main-section">
                <header>
                    <h2>More Syntax!</h2>
                </header>
                <content>
                    <p>We can style various type of elements by refering to them 
                        using IDs or classes. This is set up in html by adding those attributes to our html tags.</p>

                    <p>Here we have anexample of how you can style an element h1 
                        from the title of every section.</p>

                        <div class="code-snippet">
                            <pre>
                                <code>
                                    .section-title h1 {
                                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;background-color: red;
                                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;font-family: Helvetica;
                                    }
                                </code>
                        </pre>
                        </div>

                    <p>We can also access an element by its Id with the # symbol.</p>

                    <div class="code-snippet">
                        <pre>
                            <code>
                                #section1 {
                                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;color: grey;
                                }
                            </code>
                    </pre>
                    </div>

                    <p> We can use the class attribute to references multiple elements ç
                        so that they are styled similarly. 
                        but we can only acces one element by its Id since i HTML 
                        any given element will have a determenined Id, but we can 
                        have multiple elements with the same class.</p>

                    <p>This snippet will refer to every element thas uses this 
                        class. namely all sections will have a left border of 
                        1px, dotted.</p>

                    <code>
                        
                    </code>

                    <div class="code-snippet">
                        <pre>
                            <code>
                                .section-div {<br>

                    <p>on the other hand, with this snippet we can alter all the 
                        p elements inside the given section, referenced by the 
                        section id.</p>

                        <p>
                            All web standards technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.) 
                            are defined in giant documents called specifications 
                            (or simply "specs"), which are published by standards 
                            organizations (such as the W3C, WHATWG, ECMA, or Khronos) 
                            and define precisely how those technologies are supposed to
                             behave.
                        </p>

                        <p>CSS is no different — it is developed by a group within the
                             W3C called the CSS Working Group. This group is made of 
                             representatives of browser vendors and other companies 
                             who have an interest in CSS. There are also other people,
                              known as invited experts, who act as independent voices; 
                              they are not linked to a member organization.</p>

                        <p>New CSS features are developed, or specified, by the 
                            CSS Working Group. Sometimes because a particular 
                            browser is interested in having some capability, 
                            other times because web designers and developers 
                            are asking for a feature, and sometimes because the 
                            Working Group itself has identified a requirement. 
                            CSS is constantly developing, with new features 
                            coming available. However, a key thing about CSS 
                            is that everyone works very hard to never change 
                            things in a way that would break old websites. 
                            A website built in 2000, using the limited CSS 
                            available then, should still be usable in a browser 
                            today!</p>
                        <p>As a newcomer to CSS, it is likely that you will find 
                            the CSS specs overwhelming — they are intended for 
                            engineers to use to implement support for the features 
                            in user agents, not for web developers to read to 
                            understand CSS. Many experienced developers would much 
                            rather refer to MDN documentation or other tutorials. 
                            It is however worth knowing that they exist, 
                            understanding the relationship between the CSS you are
                             using, browser support (see below), and the specs.</p>
                        
                    </content>
                </section>
                <section id="browser_support" class="main-section">
                    <header>
                        <h2>Browser Support</h2>
                    </header>
                    <content>
                        <p>Once CSS has been specified then it is only useful
                             for us in developing web pages if one or more 
                             browsers have implemented it. This means that 
                             the code has been written to turn the instruction 
                             in our CSS file into something that can be output 
                             to the screen. We'll look at this process more in 
                             the lesson How CSS works. It is unusual for all 
                             browsers to implement a feature at the same time, 
                             and so there is usually a gap where you can use 
                             some part of CSS in some browsers and not in others. 
                             For this reason, being able to check implementation 
                             status is useful. On each property page on MDN you 
                             can see the status of the property you are interested 
                             in, so you can tell if you will be able to use it on 
                             a website.</p>

                             <p>Some common browsers the public use are:</p>
